method bottom(Stack s)
	Make empty Stack t
	While s.isEmpty() is false
		Pop value from s onto temp variable
		Push the temp variable on to stack t
	Make topValue variable and get the top value on stack t using t.top()
	Return topValue
Running time: O(n) because the while loop ends as soon a stack s is empty so the running time depends on n, n being the size of the stack.
