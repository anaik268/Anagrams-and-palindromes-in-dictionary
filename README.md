# Anagrams-and-palindromes-in-dictionary
This program finds the word with most anagrams within a text file containing over 113 thousand words. It also finds palindromes within a file.

Problem the program is solving:

An anagram is a word obtained by reordering the letters of another word.
For example, “once” and “cone” are anagrams. Note that each letter must
be reused exactly once, so anagrams must have the same number of letters.
Which word in the English language has the most anagrams? Let us
take “words in the English language” to mean words in the file “words.txt”
in the LISTS directory on afs.
